* Model: `15M` | Prompt: `Once upon a time,` | Sampling Technique: `Greedy sampling`
    ```
    Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy food. One day, she found a big, round thing in her room. It was a microscope. Lily was very curious about it.
    Lily wanted to see what was inside the microscope. She tried to open it, but it was very hard. She tried and tried, but she could not open it. Lily felt sad and wanted to find a way to open the microscope.
    Then, Lily had an idea. She asked her mom for help. Her mom showed her how to open the microscope. Lily was so happy! She looked through the microscope and saw many tiny things. She was so excited to see the tiny things. Lily and her mom had a fun day together.
    ```
* Prompt: `Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a fearful little dog named Spot` | Sampling Technique: `Greedy sampling`
    ```
    Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a fearful little dog named Spot. Spot was scared of many things. One day, Spot saw a big tree with a hole in it. He thought, "I want to see what is inside the hole."
    Spot went to the tree and looked inside the hole. He saw a little bird with a hurt wing. Spot said, "I will help you, little bird." He used his paw to gently lift the bird out of the hole. The bird was very happy and said, "Thank you, Spot!"
    Spot and the bird became good friends. They played together in the forest every day. Spot learned that it is good to help others, even if they are scared of something. And they lived happily ever after.
    ```

### [Transfusion (A Multi-Modal Transformer)](https://github.com/VachanVY/Transfusion.torch)
* Transfusion is a Multi-Modal Transformer, it can generate text like GPTs and images like Diffusion Models, all at once in one go not separately!
* It can easily switch between text and image modalities for generations, and it is nothing complicated, just a single transformer with some modality-specific components!
* This can easily be extended to other modalities like videos, audio, etc, but for now, it can only take images and text as input
* **`TODO`: Train on a large Multi-Modal Dataset (something like tiny stories dataset with images in between illustrating the story...?)**
