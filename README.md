Hi, I'm Vachan. I like to build and train Deep Neural Networks from scratch.

# Projects:
## [NeuroForge](https://github.com/VachanVY/NeuroForge)
* Neural Network made from scratch including backpropagation, the equations are explained with pen and paper, then coded

## [gpt.jax](https://github.com/VachanVY/gpt.jax)
* GPT written in jax, trained on the tinystories dataset

## [Vision-Transformers](https://github.com/VachanVY/Vision-Transformers)
* Vision Transformers in jax, trained on MNIST dataset

## [Diffusion-Transformers](https://github.com/VachanVY/Diffusion-Transformers)
* On going project... Private for now...
